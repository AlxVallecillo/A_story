at the very beggning 
create a dir "mkdir" then create a file example.txt

you can use the VIM to edit example.txt,
use "git status"  to check files commited
use "" git add example.txt "" to commit files to working master, to add a commit messgage use git -m commit "a message"
see the commits so far with 
"git log"

to check file diferrences use "git diff "

to go back to file last version state use " git checkout filename.txt "
to be able to add the project to a remote repository, first go to github.com create an account and then create a repository that we will be using to save the project on that repository.

use type in "" git remote add origin <URL of the repository> "
to push the repository to the remote web repository use cmd
"" git push -u origin master ""
